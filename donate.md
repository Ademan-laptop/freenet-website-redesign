## {% gt How can I donate? %}

    Recurring donations give the project a more stable and dependable income which makes it easier to make long-term commitments to potential developers.
    Alternatively you can make a one-time donation.{% endgettext %}

{% endgettext %}

# {% gt Why donate %}

{% gettext %}
Although countless people have given their time and skill to the project since its inception, 
The Freenet Project relies on your donations to cover hosting and administrative costs 
(i.e. domain registrations and certificates).
If we have enough funds, we can hire developers to work on Freenet.
{% endgettext %}

{% gettext %}
Freenet is a platform for censorship-resistant communication and publishing. 
For the past 15 years the project has built tools to fight for freedom of speech and information. 
Our software provides a decentralized peer-to-peer network
designed to hide who publishes or accesses potentially controversial 
information - or even that it exists - especially useful
for those living in oppressive political regimes.
{% endgettext %}

{% gettext %}
While development is primarily driven by volunteers, 
the project has also employed paid developers to provide more focused work. 
Over the past 2 years, the project's paid developer has made great progress 
improving “Web of Trust” functionality to combat spam,
which is a central problem in any anonymous system. 
Unfortunately, the Freenet Project no longer has enough money to retain his services, 
so he is now a volunteer. This greatly reduces his capacity to continue this important work.
{% endgettext %}

{% gettext %}
We are excited for the future of Freenet and the projects built on top of it. 
There is so much more work to do, and full-time developers greatly benefit the project.
{% endgettext %}

{% gettext %}
Help us keep Internet freedom alive and expand human liberty.
